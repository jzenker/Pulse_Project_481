        <h1>What is this project about?</h1>
        <h3>It is often thought that everyone in the field of computer science is a software developer. In reality, the scope of computer science is much broader and draws from many disciplines. By combining disciplines, we are able to create interdisciplinary projects that may have otherwise been deemed unusual or impossible. Following that model, this project’s inspiration drew from personal interests like interactive design, interior design and hardware implementation. The original purpose of Pulse was intended to create an immersive sculpture to collect physiological data, from several individuals, in response to changes within the sculpture’s environment. Interested in seeing how heart rate was impacted specifically, the sculpture was to host a study to see if certain light colors or placements within the space could cause individuals to respond in different ways, allowing us to better understand the importance of our surroundings when it comes to our physical health and well being. In light of the unprecedented events that have occurred in the last month, the nature of Pulse was shifted to serve the need of social distancing by refraining from doing a study with people to solely focusing on creating a tool to make it possible. The newly designed sculpture no longer fully drew importance from the data it received but instead was designed to send and display data in a streamlined way regardless of the technical challenges, dead ends and obstacles that were faced. Problems manifested themselves in miswired circuits, conflicting research, failed heart rate monitor creations and colliding microcontrollers and sensors. This paper will discuss the accomplishments of this project and the future possibilities from the creation of this tool.</h3>
